# Bowles-Hall-App-Android
An open source app for Bowles Hall Residential College.

BHRC is a residence hall at the University of California, Berkeley. This upcoming year,
after the hall has been renovated from it's original 1982 state, people of the Bowles Hall Phoenix Program
and other new residents will be moving into Bowles Hall. Within this small community of students, we figured
it would be fun to have a personal app for the hall with unique features specific to the community.

Not necessarily intended for public use, but whatever.
